    \brief A container in which all animations are defined.

    GraphTransition is a container for animations inside on Graphs2D. Define this class
    inside a graph type to enable animated changes for XYSeries within 2D graphs. To
    define individual animations, add them inside of the GraphTransition. The
    individual animations within the same GraphTransition are animated in parallel. If
    a GraphTransition is found by the graph during a call to a supported function
    which appends or replaces a point, then the values are interpolated according to
    the animations that are added.

    This example shows how to define a GraphTransition within a graph.

    \snippet doc_src_qmlgraphs.cpp 11

    \note GraphTransition requires it to be defined directly inside the graph which needs to be animated.
    Currently only XYSeries are supported.
