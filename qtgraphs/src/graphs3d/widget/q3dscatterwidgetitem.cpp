 * \class Q3DScatterWidgetItem
 * \inmodule QtGraphsWidgets
 * \ingroup graphs_3D_widgets
 * \brief The Q3DScatterWidgetItem class provides methods for rendering 3D scatter graphs.
 *
 * This class enables developers to render 3D scatter graphs and view them by freely
 * rotating the scene. Rotation is achieved by holding down the right mouse button
 * and moving the mouse, while zooming is accomplished using the mouse wheel. If
 * enabled, selection is performed with the left mouse button. The scene can be
 * reset to the default camera view by clicking the mouse wheel. On touch devices,
 * rotation is achieved by tap-and-move, selection by tap-and-hold, and zooming
 * by pinch.
 *
 * If no axes are set explicitly to Q3DScatterWidgetItem, temporary default axes with no
 * labels are created. These default axes can be modified via axis accessors,
 * but as soon any axis is set explicitly for the orientation, the default axis
 * for that orientation is destroyed.
 *
 * Q3DScatterWidgetItem supports more than one series visible at the same time.
 *
 * Q3DScatterWidgetItem has transparency support. This feature allows you to adjust
 * the opacity of the scatter points, making them partially see-through,
 * fully transparent, or opaque.
 *
 * \section1 How to construct a minimal Q3DScatterWidgetItem graph
 *
 * First, construct Q3DScatterWidgetItem. Since we are running the graph as the top-level
 * window in this example, we need to clear the \c Qt::FramelessWindowHint flag,
 * which is set by default:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 0
 *
 * Now Q3DScatterWidgetItem is ready to receive data to be rendered. Add one series of 3
 * QVector3D items:
 *
 * \note In the new proxy-series relationship, data is held in series.
 * Therefore, for the proxy to be able to add, delete, or edit the data, it is
 * a prerequisite to create a series first.
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 1
 *
 * Finally you will need to set it visible:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 2
 *
 * The complete code needed to create and display this graph is:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 3
 *
 * And this is what those few lines of code produce:
 *
 * \image q3dscatter-minimal.png
 *
 * The scene can be rotated, zoomed into, and an item can be selected to view
 * its position, but no other interactions are included in this minimal code
 * example. You can learn more by familiarizing yourself with the examples
 * provided, like the \l{Simple Scatter Graph}.
