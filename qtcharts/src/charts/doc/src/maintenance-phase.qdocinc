\note The Qt Charts module is in the maintenance phase. For new projects,
consider using the \l{Qt Graphs} module. To render 2D charts, QtGraphs
uses \l {Qt Quick Shapes QML Types} {Qt Quick Shapes}, which is a more
modern GUI technology compared to the outdated Qt Graphics View Framework
used by the Qt Charts module.
