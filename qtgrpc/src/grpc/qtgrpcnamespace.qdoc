    \enum QtGrpc::SerializationFormat

    \brief Contains preset values for setting the protobuf serializer format.

    \sa QGrpcSerializationFormat

    \value Default
//! [serialization-format-default]
    The default QGrpcSerializationFormat preset. This preset constructs a \l
    QProtobufSerializer with an empty content type suffix.
//! [serialization-format-default]

    \value Protobuf
//! [serialization-format-protobuf]
    The embedded protobuf QGrpcSerializationFormat preset. This preset
    constructs a \l QProtobufSerializer with the \c proto content type suffix.
//! [serialization-format-protobuf]

    \value Json
//! [serialization-format-json]
    The embedded JSON QGrpcSerializationFormat preset. This preset constructs a
    \l QProtobufJsonSerializer with the \c json content type suffix.
//! [serialization-format-json]

/*!
    \enum QtGrpc::StatusCode

    \brief Channel's status codes.

    \value Ok No error
    \value Cancelled The operation was cancelled, typically by the caller.
    \omitvalue Unknown
    \value InvalidArgument The client specified an invalid argument,
    \value DeadlineExceeded The deadline expired before the operation
    could complete,
    \value NotFound Some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was
    not found.
    \value AlreadyExists The entity that a client attempted to create
    (e.g., file or directory) already exists.
    \value PermissionDenied  The caller does not have permission to execute
    the specified operation.
    \c PermissionDenied must not be used for rejections caused by exhausting
    some resource (use \c ResourceExhausted instead for those errors).
    \c PermissionDenied must not be used if the caller can not be identified
    (use \c Unauthenticated instead for those errors).
    This error code does not imply the request is valid or the requested
    entity exists or satisfies other pre-conditions.
    \value ResourceExhausted Some resource has been exhausted, perhaps
    a per-user quota, or perhaps the entire file system is out of space.
    \value FailedPrecondition The operation was rejected because the system
    is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
    \value Aborted The operation was aborted, typically due to
    a concurrency issue such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.
    \value OutOfRange The operation was attempted past the valid range.
    \value Unimplemented The operation is not implemented or is
    not supported/enabled in this service.
    \value Internal This means that some invariants expected by
    the underlying system have been broken.
    \value Unavailable The service is currently unavailable.
    This is most likely a transient condition, which can be corrected
    by retrying with a backoff. Note that it is not always safe
    to retry non-idempotent operations.
    \value DataLoss Unrecoverable data loss or corruption.
    \value Unauthenticated The request does not have valid authentication
    credentials for the operation.
