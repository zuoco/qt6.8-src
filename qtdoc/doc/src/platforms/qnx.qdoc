    \section1 QNX releases and architectures

    Qt 6 is currently tested and supported on QNX SDP 7.1 and on QNX SDP 8.0.
    Supported target architectures are limited on what QNX SDPs support.

    \section2 QNX SDP 7.1 support

    The following architectures are supported:

    \list
        \li \c ARMle-v7 (32-bit)
        \li \c AArch64le (64-bit)
        \li \c x86-64 (64-bit)
    \endlist

    \section2 QNX SDP 8.0 support

    The following architectures are supported:

    \list
        \li \c AArch64le (64-bit)
        \li \c x86-64 (64-bit)
    \endlist

    \section3 Support notes

    Pre-built Qt binaries are not delivered due to possible binary compatibility
    issues between different QNX SDP installations. This means that automatic Qt
    Creator Kits are not available for QNX SDP 8.0 either. However, manual Kit
    creation is possible.

    *QNX SDP 8.0 doesn't currently support multimedia, which means that qtMultimedia and
    the dependent components cannot be compiled.

    \section1 Host systems

    QNX has been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows hosts but may work on other host
    systems.

    \section1 Pre-built binaries

    The pre-built Qt binaries for QNX SDP 7.1 are delivered through Qt Online Installer.
    These binaries have been created using the QNX SDP installation from Qt's continuous
    integration (CI) system. These binaries are only for preliminary testing and trials,
    so there is no guarantee that the QNX SDP content matches with the current default
    installation from QNX Software Center. The safest way to avoid binary compatibility
    issues is always to build Qt binaries using your own QNX SDP installation.

    \nextpage Qt for QNX runtime target requirements
    \title Building Qt for QNX
    \ingroup qnxcontent
    \brief Describes required packages and necessary configuration for building.

    \section1 Setting up QNX SDP

    Building Qt 6 requires downloading and installing a QNX SDP from the
    \l{QNX website}.
    \note A suitable license is required. \l {mailto://info@qnx.com}{Contact QNX}
    for more information.

    \note Don't add experimental Wayland packages from QNX Software Center to your
    QNX SDP 8.0 installation. They are not needed to build Qt but can cause a header
    conflict when configuring a Qt build.

    The compiler and other parts of the toolchain are provided in the SDP
    packages. Initialize your build environment by running the QNX setup script
    from your SDP installation folder in a terminal as follows:

    \badcode
    source qnxsdp-env.sh
    \endcode

    Or run qnxsdp-env.bat on the Windows command shell.

    \section1 Host build

    A host build of Qt needs to be available to cross-compile Qt. This is because, during
    the build, certain tools (such as \c{moc}, \c{rcc}, \c{qmlcachegen}, and \c{qsb}) are
    invoked from the host build. You have two options:
    \list
        \li \l{Building Qt Sources} for the host or
        \li installing host build using \QOI.
    \endlist

    \section1 Creating a toolchain file for QNX

    To cross-compile a project with CMake, you need a toolchain file. This
    CMake language file sets the correct values for the platform name,
    compiler/linker, and many other toolchain-specific things. For reference,
    you can find toolchain files used in CI from source package
    \l {https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qt5.git/tree/coin/provisioning/common/shared/cmake_toolchain_files}{coin/provisioning/common/shared/cmake_toolchain_files}

    \badcode
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME QNX)
    set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR armle-v7)
    set(arch gcc_ntoarmv7le)

    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER qcc)
    set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER q++)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})

    set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH $ENV{QNX_TARGET};$ENV{QNX_TARGET}/${CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR})

    set(CMAKE_SYSROOT $ENV{QNX_TARGET})
    \endcode

    The example file is for \c armv7le. The other possibilities are \c aarch64le and \c x86_64,
    depending on your target architecture.

    \note Cmake doesn't pass STRIP, AR, RANLIB and NM variables correctly on QNX, so if used,
    they need to be specified separately in a toolchain file.

    \section1 Configuring and building Qt for QNX

    To configure and build Qt for QNX, you need the following:
    \list
        \li Tools for building Qt, as described in \l{Building Qt Sources}, are in place and
            functional for your host platform.
        \li The toolchain file, in this example \c{$HOME/qnx.cmake}.
        \li The Qt source code checked out or installed, in this example under \c{$HOME/qt}.
        \li Host build of Qt, in this example \c{$HOME/qt-host}.
        \li Prefix for the Qt build installation location on the local system, in this example
        \c{$HOME/qnx-install}.
        \li Prefix for the Qt build deployment location on the target device, in this example
        \c{/qt}.
    \endlist

    After creating and switching to the \c build directory, run the following:

    \badcode
    $HOME/qt/configure -nomake examples -nomake tests \
    -qt-host-path $HOME/qt-host \
    -extprefix $HOME/qnx-install \
    -prefix /qt \
    -- -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$HOME/qnx.cmake  \
    -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=710  \
    $HOME/qt
    \endcode

    Since Qt 6, the configure tool is a wrapper around CMake and in practice,
    this configure command is equivalent to the following direct CMake call:
    \badcode
    cmake -GNinja -DQT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DQT_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
    -DQT_HOST_PATH=$HOME/qt-host \
    -DCMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX=$HOME/qnx-install \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/qt \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$HOME/qnx.cmake  \
    -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=710  \
    $HOME/qt
    \endcode

    Choose the value of CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION based on your QNX SDP version:
    \list
        \li 710 for QNX SDP 7.1
        \li 800 for QNX SDP 8.0
    \endlist

    If you are working only with one QNX version, you can also define CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
    in your toolchain file.

    \note When building on Windows, PCH (Precompiled Headers) needs to be explicitly disabled,
    as enabling it causes the QNX compiler to crash. To disable PCH, use the configuration
    option \c{-no-pch}.

    \note If using QNX SDP 8.0, skip unsupported and their dependent modules using configuration
    options \c{-skip qtmultimedia -skip qtspeech -skip qtremoteobjects -skip qtinterfaceframework}.

    Once the configuration completes without errors, build Qt by running the following:
    \code
    cmake --build . --parallel
    \endcode
    \note QNX compiler may require more memory than the compiler used for host build.
    Use \c{--parallel <numOfProcesses>} to limit the maximum number of concurrent processes
    when building.

    Once built, run the following:
    \code
    cmake --install .
    \endcode

    This installs the results to \c{$HOME/qnx-install}. From there you can deploy the Qt build
    to target device using Qt Creator, scp directly or some another method. The \c{-prefix}
    configuration parameter (/qt in the example) defines the deployment location on target device.

    \sa {Qt Configure Options}, {Configuring Qt}

    \section1 Building applications for the target device

    When you have finished the Qt build and it's installed in the staging location,
    you can build examples or applications.

    With CMake, use the generated \c{qt-cmake} script in the bin directory of the staging location
    (\c{$HOME/qnx-install} in the example) to configure the application build and then run ninja.
    For example:

    \badcode
    $HOME/qnx-install/bin/qt-cmake .
    cmake --build .
    \endcode

    You can then deploy the resulting application binary to the device. Using the \c{qt-cmake}
    helper script is convenient because the script ensures the toolchain file that was used
    for building Qt is loaded, so there is no need to repeatedly specify it for each application.

    If you are using a Qt installation that has not been built on your machine, \c{qt-cmake} needs
    to know the location of the CMake toolchain file for the target platform.

    In such a case, instruct \c{qt-cmake} to chain load a custom toolchain file
    by setting the \c{QT_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE} variable as follows:

    \badcode
    $HOME/qnx-install/bin/qt-cmake -DQT_CHAINLOAD_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$HOME/qnx.cmake .
    \endcode

    When building applications in Qt Creator using Qt installation that has not been
    built in your machine, the \c {CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE} variable, pointing to local toolchain
     file, needs to be added to kit configuration (\b {Edit > Preferences > Kits}).

    For more information on connecting and adding kits for QNX devices while using Qt Creator,
    see \l {https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-qnx.html} {Connecting QNX devices}.

    \section1 Third party libraries

    Make sure that your system image contains the following additional
    third-party libraries which are not always included in minimal QNX Neutrino
    RTOS images:

    \list
        \li \c libfontconfig
        \li \c libfreetype
        \li \c libiconv
        \li \c libicui18n
        \li \c libicudata
        \li \c libicuuc
        \li \c libpng16
        \li \c libxml2
        \li \c libsqlite3
        \li \c libssl
        \li \c libcrypto
        \li \c libzstd
    \endlist

    \note This is not a complete list of shared libraries used by Qt on QNX
          Neutrino OS. Multiple shared libraries are already available in a
          typical OS image, or included by other parts of the system, for
          example \c Screen.
*/

/*!
    \page qnx-target-requirements.html
    \previouspage Building Qt for QNX
    \title Qt for QNX runtime target requirements
    \ingroup qnxcontent
    \brief Describes target requirements for running qt applications.

    QNX Software Systems delivers software solutions for making embedded
    devices. This includes creation of QNX Neutrino RTOS boot images in a very
    flexible way. Even though QNX provides several reference scripts for the OS
    image creation, sooner or later you will need to make changes or you might
    decide to create an OS image from scratch. Qt relies on the existence of
    several third-party components and selected OS services. Due to this, QNX
    Neutrino RTOS boot images for a target device running Qt must meet the
    requirements listed in the following sections to ensure that Qt works as
    expected.

    \section1 QNX screen graphics subsystem

    Before any Qt application can be started, the
    \l {http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/#com.qnx.doc.screen/topic/manual/cscreen_about.html}
    {QNX Screen Graphics Subsystem} (also called just "Screen") must be
    running. \c Screen consists of a driver and several utilities and services
    which are used by Qt. This includes processing of mouse and keyboard events
    as well. You can ensure that \c Screen is configured and running correctly
    by verifying that a graphics application, like \c gles2-gears, can be started
    and runs without problems.

    Most of the recent sample OS build scripts in the SDP include sections with
    all components and start commands for the Screen. You can  use them as a reference.

    \section1 IPv6 support

    \l {Qt Network}{Qt's networking stack} requires IPv6 support to be
    enabled, independent of whether the actual networking uses IPv4 or IPv6.

    \warning \c{io-pkt-v6-hc} must be running, \e {not} \c{io-pkt-v4}.

    \section1 Random device \c{/dev/random}

    Qt requires \c{/dev/random} to be present and functional. Start it
    before starting any Qt application or during the system startup:

    \badcode
    random -p
    waitfor /dev/random
    \endcode

    \section1 System logger

    QNX provides the
    \l {http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/7.1/#com.qnx.doc.neutrino.utilities/topic/s/slogger2.html}
    {slog2} logging framework tailored to specifics of embedded systems. The
    major advantage of it is a much better performance than a text output to
    files. Qt uses this framework by default for any logging output going
    through QDebug on QNX Neutrino RTOS. The \c{slog2} service should be
    started during the system startup. The \c{slog2} also relies on the
    existence of the \c{/tmp} folder which has to be configured as well, for
    example:

    \badcode
    [type=link] /tmp=/dev/shmem
    display_msg "Starting slogger2..."
    slogger2 -U1001:1000 &
    waitfor /dev/slog2
    \endcode

    \section1 Environment variables

    There is a set of environment variables you should set when starting a Qt
    application. Most of them are actually not specific to QNX Neutrino RTOS.
    They are still mentioned here, since knowing them just saves a lot of
    time in case of problems.

    \note \c setconf and \c getconf are required to access POSIX environment
    variables, especially for the host name and time and date.


    \section2 Qt runtime location

    If you did not build Qt with the RPATH environment variable set, you can
    place the Qt runtime components in any folder in the file system. The
    following environment variables should point to valid locations assuming that
    the Qt installation is located in \c{<Qt-install-path>}:

    \list
        \li \c{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} should contain the path to the Qt libraries
            in \c{<Qt-install-path>/lib}.
        \li \c{QT_PLUGIN_PATH} defines where the Qt plug-ins are located.
            It should be set to \c{<Qt-install-path>/plugins}.
        \li \c{QML2_IMPORT_PATH} defines where the Qt Quick plug-ins are
            located. It should be set to \c{<Qt-install-path>/qml}.
        \li If Qt does not use fontconfig, you must either provide the path
            to the fonts with \c{QT_QPA_FONTDIR}, or place the fonts under
            \c{<Qt-install-path>/lib/fonts} which is the default font
            location.
        \li Check \c{QT_QPA_QNX_DISPLAY_CONFIG} for the number and order of
            available screens/displays.
    \endlist

    \section2 Physical screen size

    Qt needs information about the physical dimensions of the attached
    display to determine DPI values and thus set correct font sizes. Usually,
    this information is provided by the Screen.  In some cases you may see an
    invalid screen size such as 0mmx0mm.  In such a case Qt requires an
    environment variable \c QQNX_PHYSICAL_SCREEN_SIZE set to according values to
    get the required information. If Qt applications exit with an error message
    saying that the physical screen size couldn't be determined, set the
    variable like this before starting the Qt application:

    \badcode
    export QQNX_PHYSICAL_SCREEN_SIZE=150,100
    \endcode

    to inform Qt that the screen has a width of 150mm and a height of 100mm
    in this particular case. The physical screen size is measured in millimeters
    (mm) and should correspond to the actual physical size of the display in the
    final configuration.

    \section2 Troubleshooting the first start of a Qt application

    The only drawback of the flexibility provided by QNX Neutrino RTOS
    is a risk that the run environment is slightly different on your target
    than what is expected by Qt. This is a common reason why a Qt application
    on a new target fails to start. A few generic environment variables can
    help locate the root cause for problems:

    \list
        \li Setting \c{QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS} to \c{1} helps to see why the QPA
            plugin cannot load.
        \li Setting \c{LD_DEBUG} to \c{1} helps to see where and how shared
            libraries are loaded. This can be used in combination with
            \c{QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS} when a plugin failed to load because it
            could not load other shared libraries.
        \li Setting \c{QT_LOGGING_TO_CONSOLE} will force sending all logging
            messages to \c{stderr} instead of \c{slog2}. This is useful for
            analyzing application startup problems, as you do not need to use
            another tool to see the messages.
    \endlist

    Qt normally uses \c fontconfig to provide access to systemfonts. If a font
    cache hasn't been created earlier, it will be created at the start-up of the
    first Qt application. Depending on the setup it can take a very long time
    and delay applications' start-up significantly. If not needed, fontconfig
    can be disabled with -DFEATURE_fontconfig=OFF on configure time.
